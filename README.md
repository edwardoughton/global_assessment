# global_assessment

Welcome to this introductory course on `Global Assessment`!

What is `Global Assessment`? Here this term is defined as the ability to undertake high-resolution computation of spatial processes at the planetary scale. 

Imagine the power of being able to analyze data as granular as 1 square kilometer, but for the whole globe! This is the purpose of this set of learning materials. 

This course has three main learning outcomes:

-   Firstly, developing global geospatial data analytics in Python to support decisions in industry and government. 
-   Secondly, gaining a proficient ability to work with high-resolution local data (e.g., 1 km^2) but at the global scale. 
-   Finally, running basic parallel computing scripts, both on a single machine and on a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.

The tools used focus on Python with affiliated packages such as Rasterio, GeoPandas, Matplotlib etc.
