# Global Assessment

Welcome to this introductory course on `Global Assessment`!

What is `Global Assessment`? This term is defined as the ability to undertake high-resolution computation of spatial processes at the planetary scale. 

Imagine the power of being able to analyze data as granular as 1 square kilometer, but for the whole globe! This is the purpose of this set of learning materials. 

Three main learning outcomes are identified:

-   Firstly, developing global geospatial data analytics in Python to support decisions in industry and government. 
-   Secondly, gaining a proficient ability to work with high-resolution local data (e.g., 1 km^2) but at the global scale. 
-   Finally, running basic parallel computing scripts, both on a single machine and on a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.

The tools used focus on Python with affiliated packages such as Rasterio, GeoPandas, Matplotlib etc.


## Getting started

These tutorials utilize the open-source `Anaconda` distribution which is a common approach for scientific computing. You will need to download and install `Anaconda`, which not only provides a package manager for Python, but also various virtual environment functions.

Once installed, open the anaconda prompt on Windows, or the terminal on Mac. Navigate to a suitable location to clone this repo to, e.g. your desktop or documents folder, wherever you prefer.
