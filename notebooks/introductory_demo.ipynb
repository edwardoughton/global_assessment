    "# Introductory demo to global assessment methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo provides a basic overview of the key techniques we will use in this class to extract information from raster layers, for specific boundary areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The packages utilized include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `os` which stands for 'operating system' and contains generic portable functions for using operating system dependent functionality.\n",
    "- `rasterio` which broadly stands for 'raster input-output' providing reading and writing functionality for raster formats. Once a `rasterio` object has been created this object provides a Python API based on Numpy N-dimensional arrays and GeoJSON.\n",
    "- `geopandas` which stands for 'geographic panel data' and is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. `geopandas` extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed by `shapely`, depends on `fiona` for file access and `matplotlib` for plotting.\n",
    "- `rasterstats` is a Python module for summarizing geospatial raster datasets based on vector geometries. It includes functions for zonal statistics and interpolated point queries. The command-line interface allows for easy interoperability with other GeoJSON tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem like a lot, but it pretty much covers the full gambit of packages we will use in this `Global Assessment` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you can master these packages in the relatively basic ways presented here, you will be in a very strong position to excel in this class, and subsequently get a good, well-paid job. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by importing these packages:\n"
